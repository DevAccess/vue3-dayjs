# vue3-dayjs

A wrapper for integrating Day.js into Vue.js 3

[Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API. If you use Moment.js, you already know how to use Day.js.

### You can use Day.js without using this plugin
This plugin allows you to easily include Day.js globally. This is not recommended with Vue 3, and they recommend using provide/inject instead. But if you're just getting started with Day.js or know you prefer it global, you can use this plugin to make your coding life a bit easier.
